# Reflection README
- I learned that Git is a tool used to effectivly manage multiple versions of code. Git works by seperating code versions into branches and merging those branches together when final changes want to be made. 
- GitHub is an online tool that works alongside Git to help visualize your code repositories and what changes you made to each version of code. 
- Changes to code can also be tracked on Git inside the Linux CLI before committing changes to a branch or repo.
